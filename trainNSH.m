% Main training module of Neighbor-Sensitive Hashing. For simplicity of running
% demo, we are using a few heuristics. For better performance, one may want to
% tune those parameters.
%
% param 1: number of pivots (m), currently this is set to 4 * codesize
% param 2: neighbor parameter (epsilon), currently this is set to 1.9 times the
%          average distance between a pivot and its another closest pivot.

% @param X          a data matrix (row is instance and column is feature)
% @param codesize   is the hascode length of generated binary hashcodes.
% @ret   model      is a model that contains a hash function that transforms arbitrary data
%                   matrix into a hashcode matrix.
